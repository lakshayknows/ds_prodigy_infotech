# Task 4: Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment Polarity

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Twitter data to determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) using natural language processing (NLP). The focus is on preprocessing raw text data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights from tweets.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning Twitter data by removing mentions, hashtags, URLs, and special characters.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Extracting insights and visualizing data distributions.
- **Visualization**: Displaying findings through charts and word clouds.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Key Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - nltk

## Notebook Contents
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project goals and methodology.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Loading the dataset and inspecting its structure.
   - Cleaning and preparing textual data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualizing sentiment distributions.
   - Analyzing common word usage.
4. **Conclusion**: Summary of key insights and suggestions for future work.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
